\section{Conclusions \& Future Work}
\label{sec:conc}
The idea of extracting a minimal IVC for a given property, and applications for doing so was recently introduced in \cite{Ghass16}.  However, a single IVC often does not provide a complete picture of the traceability from a property to a model.  In this paper, 
we have addressed the problem of extracting {\em all minimal} IVCs. We have shown
the correctness and completeness of our method and algorithm.  In addition, we have a substantial evaluation that shows that the performance of finding all minimal IVCs using our method is (on average) 1.6x more expensive than finding a single minimal IVC using existing methods.

Our method is inspired by a recent work in the domain of satisfiability analysis \cite{marco2016fast}. One interesting future direction is to devise similar MIVC enumeration algorithms based on other studies on MUSes extraction such as \cite{nadel2014accelerated}.  We are also looking into improving our implementation by using more  efficient methods for the \isadeq ~and \getivc ~modules used by our algorithm. Another interesting direction is to parallelize the enumeration process: it is certainly possible to ask for multiple distinct maximal models to be solved in parallel, though this may result in unnecessary work performed by some of the parallel solvers.

We also plan to investigate additional applications of the idea for software engineering activities.  When performing {\em compositional verification} of a software architecture, All-IVC techniques may be able to determine {\em minimal component sets} within an architecture that can satisfy a given set of requirements, which may be helpful for design-space exploration.

Finally, we are interested in adapting the notion of (all) validity cores for bounded model checking for quantifying how much of models have been explored by bounded analysis.
