\section{Conclusions \& Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have defined a novel coverage notion for formal verification using
the IVC concept, a useful measure in relation to
a valid safety property for inductive model checking. We have shown that our method
 is computationally efficient while 
 being accurate about the covered parts of a given design. 
 We have referred to this accuracy as preserving provability, which means 
 that a set of elements considered covered by our algorithm is sufficient 
 to establish the validity proof for every requirement in the set of specifications.
 
 We have implemented
our algorithm as part of the open source model checker JKind. Using our approach, measuring coverage is quite possible as we have shown in our experiments.
 We also benchmarked our implementation and compared it with other techniques in the literature. 
 The experiments show that the computation imposes a small overhead to the verification process. We have described how the justifiable notion of coverage proposed in this paper can be used as a
means of quantifying requirements completeness.
 
 In addition, based on the idea of multiple support sets for a specification, we 
 have introduced and discussed some other complementary coverage notions in the context of formal verification. Finally, we are in the process of developing some efficient algorithms for exploring the space of IVCs, e.g., finding a
minimum, rather than minimal support set, or finding all support sets. Having such algorithms makes the utilization of other proposed coverage practical.
