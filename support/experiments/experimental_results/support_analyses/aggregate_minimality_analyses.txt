-- we computed the size of biggest and smallest set in each model and added them together
-- the same calculation has been done for JSupport. And here is the result:


the aggregate number of elements in the SMALLEST support sets is: 3263
the aggregate number of elements in the BIGGEST support sets is: 3609
the aggregate number of elements in support sets computed by JSUPPORT is: 3078
