\section{Conclusions \& Future Work}
\label{sec:conc}

 future work:
 - explore more recent muses algorithm like \cite{Bacchus2016}

 - improve initial IVC computation algorithm by
 
 - BVC\\

~~~~~~- using built-in solver mechanism for minimization

~~~~~~- use recent work on minimizing unsat-cores like Offer's work at FMCAD'16

 - use parallel implementation of inductive methods:
 the tricky and resource-intensive part in all-ivcs is the proof part: we need to reduce the time it takes to prove a property.
