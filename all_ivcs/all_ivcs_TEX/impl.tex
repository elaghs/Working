\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:impl}

%We have implemented the inductive validity core algorithms in the
%previous section in two tools: {\em JKind}, which performs the \ucalg
%algorithm, and {\em JSupport}, which can compute either the \bfalg or
%the \ucbfalg algorithm (using JKind as a subprocess). Moreover, our
%implementation of \ucbfalg uses an additional feature of JKind to
%store and re-use discovered invariants between separate runs. This
%reduces some of the cost of attempting to re-prove a property multiple
%times. These tools operate over the Lustre
%language~\cite{Halbwachs91:lustre}, which we briefly illustrate below.

%\subsection{Lustre and IVCs}
%
%Lustre~\cite{Halbwachs91:lustre} is a synchronous dataflow language
%used as an input language for various model checkers. The textual
%models in Figures~\ref{fig:ex-before} and \ref{fig:ex-after} are
%written in Lustre. We will use model in Figure~\ref{fig:ex-before} as
%a running example in this section. For our purposes, a Lustre program
%consists of 1) input variables, {\tt x} in the example, 2) output
%variables, {\tt a}, {\tt b}, and {\tt y} in the example, and 3) an
%equation for each output variable. A Lustre program runs over discrete
%time steps. On each step, the input variables take on some values and
%are used to compute values for the output variables on the same step.
%In addition, equations may refer to the previous value of a variable
%using the {\tt pre} operator. This operator is underspecified in the
%first step, so the arrow operator, {\tt ->}, is used to guard the
%{\tt pre} operator. In the first step the expression {\tt e1 -> e2}
%evaluates to {\tt e1}, and it evaluates to {\tt e2} in all other steps.
%
%We interpret a Lustre program as a model specification by considering
%the behavior of the program under all possible input traces. Safety
%properties over Lustre can then be expressed as Boolean expressions in
%Lustre. A safety property holds if the corresponding expression is
%always true for all input traces. For example, the property for
%Figure~\ref{fig:ex-before} is {\tt y >= 0}, which is a valid property.
%
%It is straightforward to translate this interpretation of Lustre into
%the traditional initial and transition relations. We will show this by
%continuing with the example in Figure~\ref{fig:ex-before}. First we
%introduce a new Boolean variable $init$ into the state space to denote
%when the system is in its initial state, the state of the system prior
%to initialization. In the initial state, all other variables are
%completely unconstrained which models the underspecification of the pre
%operator during the first step. Then we define,
%\begin{align*}
%  &I((x, a, b, y, \mathit{init})) = \mathit{init} \\
%  &T((x, a, b, y, \mathit{init}), (x', a', b', y', \mathit{init'})) = \\
%  &\hspace{1.5cm} (a' = f(x', \ite{init}{0}{y})) \land~ \\
%  &\hspace{1.5cm} (b' = \ite{a' \geq 0}{a'}{-a'}) \land~ \\
%  &\hspace{1.5cm} (y' = b' + (\ite{init}{0}{y})) \land ~\\
%  &\hspace{1.5cm} \neg\mathit{init'}
%\end{align*}
%Note that $f$ is unspecified in Figure~\ref{fig:ex-before} and so also
%in $T$. In a real system, $f$ would be defined in the Lustre model and
%expanded in $T$. A safety property such as {\tt y >= 0} is translated
%into $\mathit{init} \lor (y \geq 0)$. Nested uses of arrow and pre
%operators are handled by introducing new output variables for nested
%expressions, though such details are unimportant for our purposes.
%
%Each equation in the Lustre program is translated into a single
%top-level conjunct in the transition relation. This is very convenient
%as the IVC of a Lustre property can be reported in terms of the output
%variables whose equations are part of the IVC. Equivalently, the
%interpretation of an IVC for a Lustre property is that any output
%variable that is not part of the IVC can be turned into an input
%variable, its equation thrown away, while preserving the validity of
%the property. Thus the granularity of the IVC analysis is determined
%by the granularity of the Lustre equations and can be adjusted by
%introducing auxiliary variables for subexpressions if desired.
%
%\subsection{JKind}
%
%JKind~\cite{jkind} is an infinite-state model checker for safety
%properties. JKind proves safety properties using multiple cooperative
%engines in parallel including $k$-induction~\cite{SheeranSS00},
%property directed reachability~\cite{Een2011:PDR}, and template-based
%lemma generation~\cite{Kahsai2011}. JKind accepts Lustre programs
%written over the theory of linear integer and real arithmetic. In the
%back-end, JKind uses an SMT solver such as Z3~\cite{DeMoura08:z3},
%Yices~\cite{Dutertre06:yices}, MathSAT~\cite{Cimatti2013:MathSAT}, or
%SMTInterpol~\cite{Christ2012:SMTInterpol}.
%
%JKind works on multiple properties simultaneously. When a property is
%proven and IVC generation is enabled, an additional parallel engine
%executes Algorithm~\ref{alg:ivc} to generate a nearly minimal IVC.
%
%JKind accepts an annotation on its input Lustre program indicating
%which outputs variables to consider for IVC generation. Output
%variables not mentioned in the annotation are implicitly included in
%all IVCs. This allows the implementation to focus on the variables
%important to the user and ignore, for example, administrative
%equations. This is even more important for tools which generate Lustre
%as they often create many such administrative equations which simply
%wire together more interesting expressions.
