\section{Motivating Example}
\label{sec:exmpl}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Not sure if this should go before or after the background section with a description of Lustre.
    \item Need a small but interesting example.  Andrew, do any of the models that you use as jkind tests
        function in this way?  It would be nice to look at what we have lying around; we need something 
        that requires invariants.
    \item It would also be good to have a few points of interest with the model-requirement pairing: 
    \item \quad   vacuity due to an overconstrained environment 
    \item \quad   definitions within the model that are irrelevant to the proof.
    \item Explain the model and the proof process.
\end{itemize}
