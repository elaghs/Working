\section{Conclusions \& Future Work}
\label{sec:conc}
The idea of extracting a minimal IVC for a given property, and applications for doing so was recently introduced in \cite{Ghass16}.  However, a single IVC often does not provide a complete picture of the traceability from a property to a model.  In this paper, we have addressed the problem of extracting {\em all minimal} IVCs. We have shown
the correctness and completeness of our method and algorithm.  In addition, we have a substantial evaluation that shows that the performance of finding all minimal IVCs is (on average) 3.4x more expensive than finding a single minimal IVC.


We also plan to investigate additional applications of the idea for software engineering activities.  When performing {\em compositional verification} of a software architecture, All-IVC techniques may be able to determine {\em minimal component sets} within an architecture that can satisfy a given set of requirements, which may be helpful for design-space exploration.
