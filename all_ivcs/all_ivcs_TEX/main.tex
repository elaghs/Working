\begin{abstract}
Symbolic model checkers can construct proofs of safety properties over complex
models, but when a proof succeeds, the results do not generally provide much
insight to the user. Recently, the notion of proof cores (for inductive model checkers, Inductive Validity Cores (IVCs)) was introduced to trace a property to a minimal set of model elements
necessary for proof. Minimal IVCs facilitate several engineering tasks (such
as traceability and analyzing requirements completeness), which usually rely
on the minimality of IVCs. However, existing algorithms for generating a
minimal IVC are either expensive or able to find an approximately minimal
IVC.

Besides minimality, computing \emph{all} minimal IVCs of a given property is
an interesting problem that provides several useful analyses, including
regression analysis for testing/proof, determination of the minimum (as
opposed to minimal) number of model elements necessary for proof, the
diversity examination of model elements leading to proof, and analyzing fault
tolerance.

This paper proposes an efficient method for finding \emph{all minimal} IVCs of a
given property proving its correctness and completeness. We benchmark our
algorithm against existing IVC-generating algorithms and show, in many cases,
the cost of finding all minimal IVCs by our technique is similar to finding a
single minimal IVC using existing algorithms.

%Symbolic model checkers can construct proofs of safety properties over complex models, but the results reported when a proof succeeds do not generally provide much insight to the user.  Recently, the notion of proof cores (for inductive model checkers, Inductive Validity Cores (IVCs)) was introduced to trace a property to a minimal set of model elements necessary for proof. Minimal IVCs can be used for several engineering tasks, including traceability, vacuity detection, and as a coverage metric for property-based verification. Such applications usually rely on the minimality of IVCs. However, existing algorithms for generating a minimal IVC are either expensive or able to find only an approximately minimal IVC.
%In addition to minimality, computing “all” minimal IVCs of a given property is an interesting problem that provides several useful analyses, including regression analysis for proof, determination of the minimum (as opposed to minimal) number of model elements necessary for proof, and the systematic examination of diversity of model elements leading to proof, which can be used for analyzing the fault tolerance of models.

We prove the correctness and completeness of our technique and benchmark our algorithm against existing IVC-generating algorithms.  We show that, in many cases, the computational cost of finding all minimal IVCs by our technique is similar to finding a single minimal IVC using existing algorithms.
