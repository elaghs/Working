\subsection{Minimality of Inductive Validity Cores}

To compute all $IVC$s of a given property, the \aivcalg ~algorithm
 makes a major assumption on the outcome of the \getivc ~module;
it assumes \getivc ~returns \emph{minimal} Inductive Validity Cores. 
However, as shown in \cite{Ghass16}, 
determining  the minimality of  an  $IVC$ is  as  hard  as
model checking. Although the $IVC$ generation algorithm proposed by Ghassabani et al. 
 in \cite{Ghass16}, called \ucalg ,
is efficient and fast, it does not guarantee minimality;
i.e. an $IVC$ obtained from \ucalg ~is either minimal or approximately minimal. 
In the \ucalg ~algorithm, $IVC$s are built upon inductive proofs, 
which usually rely on additional
lemmas (or invariants) derived by the model checking algorithms 
for strengthening the property and proving it
inductively. 
Depending on the structure of the inductive
proofs, an $IVC$ computed by \ucalg ~might still not be minimal. 
They also proposed another algorithm that guarantees 
the minimality of an $IVC$ \cite{Ghass16}, called \ucbfalg, which is a lot more expensive than the \ucalg. The \ucbfalg ~takes an $IVC$ generated by 
the \ucalg ~, and then in a brute-force way minimizes its input (Algorithm \ref{alg:ucbf}). In this section:
\begin{itemize}
\item First we discuss that the \aivcalg ~algorithm is correct even if
 the \getivc ~module does not guarantee minimality.
\item Next, we modify Algorithm \ref{alg:aivc}
 such that it grantees that the output set only contain the \textbf{minimal} $IVC$s. 
\item Then, we propose a technique that can be used by the \ucbfalg ~to
 minimize an $IVC$ very efficiently. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:ivc-not-min}
  Algorithm \ref{alg:aivc} enumerates all minimal Inductive Validity Cores
  even if \getivc ~does not guarantee minimality of an Inductive Validity Core.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
In an iteration of the \texttt{while} loop that $\isadeq (P, M)$ is $true$,
let \getivc ~returns a set $S'$ which is not minimal:
$\exists \mathcal{M} \subset S'.~ (I, \mathcal{M}) \vdash P$ and
$\forall T_i \in \mathcal{M} . ~ (I, \mathcal{M} \setminus \{T_i\}) \nvdash P$.
Therefore, there is an unexplored set $S \supseteq \mathcal{M}$ that all its supersets have already been explored, which means
$map$ is still satisfiable.
So, eventually there will be a model of $map$ that makes $M = S$ in line 7.
Suppose, again this time, \getivc ~ returns an adequate set $S''$ which is not minimal.
We know that
  $\mathcal{M} \subset S'' \subseteq S \wedge S'' \neq S' \wedge |S''| \leq |S'|$.
  Previously, set $S'$ marked all its supersets as explored. And, this time, the
  same thing happens with $S''$; hence with the same reasoning,
  eventually, all the supersets of $\mathcal{M}$ will be explored, and there will be a model of $map$ that makes $M = \mathcal{M}$ in line 7,
  which results in a minimal $IVC$ by \getivc (because $\mathcal{M}$ is minimal itself).
  Now,  $\mathcal{M}$  prunes itself from the $map$.
  Therefore, Algorithm \ref{alg:aivc} explores all minimal adequate sets even if \getivc ~
  does not guarantee minimality.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
 Algorithm \ref{alg:aivc} will terminate even if \getivc ~does not guarantee minimality.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Immediate from Theorem \ref{theorem:ivc-not-min}, \ref{theorem:aivc}, and \ref{theorem:termination}.
\end{proof}
