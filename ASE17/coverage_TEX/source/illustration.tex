We illustrate the idea of completeness metrics and the ``score" from different metrics on our altitude switch (ASW) example from Section~\ref{sec:example}.  %In so doing, we hope to motivate the need for completeness metrics and also to justify our proof-based approaches.
%
The ASW is responsible for turning on and off a device of interest, so we formulate two requirements that describe when the ASW should be {\em on} and when it should be {\em off}.  %We illustrate the results with traceability matrices produced by the Spear tool~\cite{Spear}, which is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:impl}.
%
The first attempt at formalization (property set 1) is as follows:

%\begin{definition} {\emph{ASW Requirements Version 1} }
{\smaller
\begin{verbatim}
on_p = (a1_below and a2_below) and not inhibit =>
    doi_on = true;
off_p = (a1_above and a2_above) and inhibit =>
    doi_on = false;
all_p = on_p and off_p;
\end{verbatim}
}
%\end{definition}

\end{figure}
\fi

\noindent %Informally, when both altimeters are below the threshold and not inhibited, then the DOI should be on ({\small \onp}), and when both altimeters are below the threshold and the ASW is inhibited, then the DOI should be off ({\small \offp}).
For each of the \ivccov, \maycov, and \mustcov\ metrics, {\small \allp} ~only requires {\small \texttt{\{below, d1, doi\_on\}}}. %, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:propertyset1}.
This small set of elements is due to a classic specification problem: using computed variables as the antecedents of implications.  %If these values are computed incorrectly (say, we choose the wrong threshold for {\small \aonebelow }), it may cause the property to be valid for incorrect reasons.
%
%This is alarming, and somewhat puzzling, because one would think that at least the definitions of the `below' or `above' would be necessary.  However, because the specification used the model variables \aonebelow, \atwobelow, \aoneabove, and \atwoabove, the actual valuations of the thresholds do not matter.  This situation illustrates a classic specification problem: using computed variables in the antecedents of implications.
%\footnote{\noindent ~In this case, if the computation of the variables used in the antecedent is incorrect, then our property will not verify what it is expected to verify \mike{citation to one of our papers on specification here...}; note also that this does not mean the property is necessarily {\em vacuous}.}
%
We therefore modify our properties to use inputs and constants as antecedents and derive:

{\smaller
\begin{verbatim}
on_p = ((alt1 < THRESHOLD) and (alt2 < THRESHOLD))
   and not inhibit => doi_on = true;
off_p = ((alt1 >= T_HYST) and (alt2 >= T_HYST))
   and inhibit => doi_on = false;
\end{verbatim}
}
% all_p = on_p and off_p;
%\end{definition}

\noindent In this version, distinctions emerge between the metrics.  {\small \allp } ~has two \mivc s: {\small{ \texttt{\{\{a1\_below, below, doi\_on, d1\}, \{a2\_below, below, doi\_on, d1\}\}}}},
because of the {\small { \onp }} ~property: in the implementation, the DOI is turned on when either of the altimeters is below the threshold, while our property states that they both must be below.
%Domain experts determine that the requirement is correctly specified and that our implementation is a reasonable refinement %, so there is no need to change the model or the property.
The MUST elements remain the same: {\small{ \texttt{\{below, doi\_on, d1\}}}}, because neither {\small \aonebelow }~ or {\small {\atwobelow}} ~is required for all proofs, and   %However, given the MUST elements, we can no longer construct a proof, because at one of these definitions is necessary for either proof.
the MAY elements contain both {\small \aonebelow } ~and {\small \atwobelow }.

The {\small { \abovehyst, \aoneabove, \atwoabove,} } and {\small{ \dtwo }} ~equations are still missing, meaning that the ``above'' thresholds are irrelevant to our properties.  We realize we are missing a hysteresis case, and end up with the following set of properties:

{\smaller
\begin{verbatim}
on_p = ((alt1 < THRESHOLD) and (alt2 < THRESHOLD))
   and not inhibit => doi_on = true;
off_p = ((alt1 >= T_HYST) and (alt2 >= T_HYST))
   or inhibit => doi_on = false;
hyst_p = not inhibit and
         (alt1 > THRESHOLD and alt2 > THRESHOLD) and
         (alt1 < T_HYST or alt2 < T_HYST) =>
   (doi_on = false -> doi_on = pre(doi_on))
all_p = on_p and off_p and hyst_p;
\end{verbatim}
}

\iffalse

Examining {\small \offp }, we realize that we have a specification error; the DOI should be off if either  {\small \inhibit }
~is true or both altimeters are above the threshold. The fix is:

\begin{definition} {\emph{ASW Requirements Version 2} }
{\smaller
\begin{verbatim}
off_p = ((alt1 >= T_HYST) and (alt2 >= T_HYST))
  or inhibit => doi_on = false;
\end{verbatim}
}
on_p = ((alt1 < THRESHOLD) and (alt2 < THRESHOLD))
   and not inhibit => doi_on = true;
all_p = on_p and off_p;
\end{definition}

\noindent Now the {\small{ \allp}} ~requirement proof yields a single \mivc ~that requires all variables except {\small{ \{\texttt{d2}\}}}, so \mivc ~= MAY = MUST.  Interestingly, the {\small{\offp}} ~proof requires both the lower altimeter thresholds even though the {\small{ \onp}} ~proof does not; the reason is that if either of these is false, then {\small{ \doion}} ~will be true.  To cover {\small{ \{\texttt{d2}\}}}, we realize no property covers the hysteresis case, so an additional property is added for this case:

%\begin{definition} {\emph{ASW Requirements Version 2} }
%{\smaller
%\begin{verbatim}
%hyst_p = not inhibit and
%         (alt1 > THRESHOLD and alt2 > THRESHOLD) and
%         (alt1 < T_HYST or alt2 < T_HYST) =>
%   (doi_on = false -> doi_on = pre(doi_on))
%all_p = on_p and off_p and hyst_p;
%\end{verbatim}
%}
%on_p = ((alt1 < THRESHOLD) and (alt2 < THRESHOLD))
%   and not inhibit => doi_on = true;
%all_p = on_p and off_p;
%\end{definition}
\fi

\noindent The hysteresis property states that if the antecedent conditions hold, then in the initial state, the {\small{\doion}}
variable is assigned false, and in subsequent steps, it retains the same value as it previously had.  %As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:propertyset4},
This property set, which includes all variables for all measures, can reasonably be seen as describing the interesting behavior of the model.
%For this property set, the measures coincide and include all variables.



\iffalse

\end{figure}
\fi
  %However, the measures are certainly not foolproof; it turns out that using {\em only} the hysteresis property {\small{ \hystp}} ~will {\em also} yield a ``complete'' result for all of the metrics: to establish its validity, all of the equations that we have defined in the model are required.  This is because the partitioning of the transition system (i.e., the equations) is insufficiently {\em granular} to detect the incompleteness.
%However, this one property would not reasonably be considered a complete specification.
%We will examine this situation further in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}.
%We will examine this situation further in the discussion section~\mike{add this!}.

%\mike{How would we define a metric that would flag the model as incomplete?  Model transformation would do it: if we added separate variables for each assignment of doi\_on, then any of the metrics would flag the \hystp\ spec as incomplete.}
