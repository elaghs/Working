In this section, we examine our experimental results to address the above research questions over the performance of our algorithm.

\textbf{RQ1)} We measured the performance overhead of the algorithms over the time
necessary to find a proof using inductive model checking. Fig. \ref{fig:performance}
 allows a visualization of the  overhead  of the \aivcalg ~algorithm  in  comparison  with \ucalg ~and \ucbfalg.
 In the figure, the models are ranked along the x-axis by the number of IVCs found by \ucalg ~per model.
 Table \ref{tab:runtime} and Table \ref{tab:overhead} also provide a summary of the computation time and the overhead of different algorithms.
 As it can be seen, the \ucalg ~algorithm imposes a negligible overhead to the proof time and is quite fast, whereas \ucbfalg ~algorithm adds a substantial penalty in order to find a single IVC.
 The \aivcalg ~algorithm is able to outperform the \ucbfalg ~in a lot of cases,
 or perform approximately the same.
 Note that the \aivcalg ~algorithm could have had better (worse) performance
 if timeout had been set lower (higher), which cause the average results shown in Table \ref{tab:runtime} and Table \ref{tab:overhead} implies that \aivcalg ~is three times more expensive than \ucbfalg .

\textbf{RQ2)} The structure of the model and specification can play a part in how well \aivcalg ~performs.
Therefore, we would like to examine whether or not there is a relationship between the performance and the size of the model, proof-time, and the diversity of IVCs. A graph showing the size of each model (determined by the number of equations in the model) and the number of IVCs
 along with the running time of \aivcalg ~and normal verification time is shown in Fig \ref{fig:modelsize}. In the figure, the models are ranked along the x-axis by their size. The picture shows that as models get larger, it is more likely for the \aivcalg ~algorithm to take more time to complete. However, there is no straightforward relationship between the performance and the number of IVCs. It can be expected that the running time of the \aivcalg ~algorithm goes higher when verification takes more time.

\textbf{RQ3)} Table \ref{tab:ivcsize} compares
the  minimum,  maximum,  average,
and standard deviation of the size of the IVCs computed by the different algorithms.
For the \aivcalg ~algorithm, the  minimum,  maximum,  average,
and standard deviation of the size of the IVCs per model is calculated, and then again, these four measures are calculated among all models.
As for the \texttt{minimum IVC} row, the four measures are calculated among the size of minimum IVC from the \aivcalg ~computation is obtained per model. The size of IVCs computed by \ucalg ~and \ucbfalg are quite close to each other, which means the \ucalg ~algorithm computes IVCs that are very close to the minimal ones obtained from the \ucbfalg , which makes it a reasonable choice 
to use the \ucalg ~algorithm for the \getivc ~procedure in Algorithm \ref{alg:aivc} 
although it does not guarantee minimality. 
Fig. \ref{fig:ratio} also demonstrates that average cost of \aivcalg ~per IVC is very close to average cost of finding one IVC by \ucbfalg. Given the fact that the size of IVCs generated by \ucalg ~is very close to the ones generated by \ucbfalg, makes the \ucalg ~algorithm 
more efficient for the \getivc procedure.

\textbf{RQ4)} In the benchmarks, there have been 
several models containing undecidable cases which affected the average 
performance reported in Table \ref{tab:runtime}. Moreover, such cases also influence the minimality of the IVCs computed by \aivcalg. It is also possible that an iteration of 
the \texttt{while} loop in Algorithm \ref{alg:aivc} times out while 
the adequacy of the subset under examination is decidable in general. 
We were interested in determining how often it is possible to come across such cases in our benchmarks. Size of IVCs obtained from different algorithm is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:min}. 
As you can see, there are 14 cases among 476 models for which the size of
 minimum IVC computed by the \aivcalg ~is bigger than the size of the minimal IVC 
 generated by the \ucbfalg ~algorithm.
