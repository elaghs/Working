We are interested in examining the {\em efficacy} and {\em efficiency} of generating all minimal inductive validity cores, as compared to algorithms for computing a {\em single approximately minimal} IVC, and a {\em minimal IVC} as implemented in~\cite{Ghass16} using the \ucalg\ and \ucbfalg\ algorithms, respectively.  We would also like to know how performance is affected by the size of models and number of minimal IVCs.  Finally, we are also interested in determining whether the AIVC approach generates {\em smaller} cores than are generated by the \ucbfalg\ algorithm that generates a single MIVC.  %If the AIVC algorithm is similarly efficient to \ucbfalg\ then several analyses can be performed that would not be possible with a single MIVC computed from the \ucbfalg\ algorithm.
%
%
Therefore, we investigate the following research questions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{RQ1:} How well does the \aivcalg ~algorithm for determining all minimal IVCs perform compared to the \ucalg ~and \ucbfalg ~algorithms, which find a single approximately minimal and guaranteed minimal IVC?
  \item \textbf{RQ2:} How is the verification time of the \aivcalg ~algorithm affected by the baseline proof time and the number of IVCs that can be found for a property?
%
%  \item \textbf{RQ3)} How does approximating minimality influence the performance of the \aivcalg ~algorithm?
%  In other words, we would like to determine, for the implementation of the \getivc ~procedure, whether it would be better to use \ucalg ~or \ucbfalg .
%  \item \textbf{RQ4)} How did the pre-set timeout manifest itself in the experimental results?
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Experimental Setup}
Our experiment used the same benchmark suite as \cite{Ghass16} to enable straightforward comparison between the approaches. The benchmark contains 476 Lustre models  from~\cite{Hagen08:FMCAD} and \cite{QFCS15:backes,hilt2013}.
Most of the benchmark models from~\cite{Hagen08:FMCAD} are small (10kB or less, with 6-40 equations) and include a range of hardware benchmarks and software problems involving counters that are difficult to solve inductively.
The models from \cite{QFCS15:backes,hilt2013} are industrial models with over 600 equations and each are approximately 80kB in size.  Each benchmark model has a single property to analyze.  For each test model, we computed \aivcalg , \ucalg , and \ucbfalg ~algorithms in a configuration with the \texttt{Z3} solver and the ``fastest'' mode of \texttt{JKind} (which involves running the K-induction and PDR engines in parallel and terminating when a solution is found). The experiments were run on an  Intel(R) i5-4690, 3.50GHz, 16 GB memory machine running Windows 10.
