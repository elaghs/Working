In this section, we examine our experimental results from three perspectives: performance, minimality of \ucalg results, and diversity.

\iffalse
\mike{Results and Discussion:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item (Overview) Give an overview of results, possibly referencing a graph or two.
    \item Statistical analysis: provide positive and null hypotheses for the research questions.
    \item Evaluation of research questions: statistical results and explanations of the graphs.  One subsection per research question?
    \item Threats to validity: what are our threats?
    Internal validity: not really necessary, I think.
    External validity (how much can the results be generalized):
        1. currently all models are *very small*;
        2. Many programs were drawn from mutations of a relatively small number of ``seed'' programs;
        3. The models are written in Lustre rather than FOL.  This means that the
            top-level conjunctions are all over equations rather than general
            form;
        4. Others?!?
    Construct validity: we are measuring what we think we're measuring: IVC and minimality are reasonably defined.  For discussions of ``completeness'' and ``traceability'' we need to be clear about any claims (probably not in this paper).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance}
\label{sec:performance}

In this subsection, we examine the performance of our inductive validity core algorithms (research question \textbf{RQ1}).  First we examine the performance overhead of the \ucalg algorithm over the time necessary to find a proof using inductive model checking.  To examine this question, we use the default {\em fastest} option of JKind which terminates when either the $k$-induction or PDR algorithm finds a proof.  To measure the performance overhead of the \ucalg algorithm, we execute it over the proof generated by the {\em fastest} option.

Since the \ucalg algorithm uses the UNSAT core facilities of the
underlying SMT solver, the performance is dependent on the efficiency
of this part of the solver. Looking at Tables~\ref{tab:runtime-ucalg}
and~\ref{tab:overhead-ucalg}, it is possible to examine both the
computation time for analysis using the four solvers under evaluation
and the overhead imposed by the \ucalg algorithm.
Figure~\ref{fig:performance} allows a visualization of the runtime for
the \ucalg algorithm running different solvers. The data suggests that
Yices (the default solver in JKind) and Z3 are the most performant
solvers both in terms of computation time and overhead.

%Figure~\ref{fig:runtimez3} allows a visualization of the overhead for the Z3 solver, where the models are ranked on the x axis in terms of their analysis time without performing \ucalg, and the y-axis describes analysis time with and without \ucalg.

%\mike{Add the raw timings for each solver for proof and proof + \ucalg analysis in Table~\ref{tab:overhead}.}

%Although it is relatively obvious from Table~\ref{tab:overhead}, it is straightforward to demonstrate with statistical significance that Z3 outperforms other solvers.  The hypotheses are as follows: \mike{FILL IN HYPOTHESES}.

%\mike{Do we need hypotheses here?  We could say a 'moderate' performance penalty is under 50\% over the regular solver time}.

\takeaway{The \ucalg algorithm using the Z3 and Yices SMT solvers adds a modest performance penalty to the time required for inductive proofs.}

Next, we consider the overhead of \ucalg vs.\ \bfalg.  Recall from Section~\ref{sec:ivc} that \bfalg requires $n$ model checking runs, where $n$ is the number of conjuncts in the transition relation. As expected, the performance is approximately a linear multiple of the size of the model, so larger models yield substantially lower performance.\footnote{for Lustre models, the number of conjuncts is equivalent to the number of equations in the Lustre model.}  We run the brute-force algorithm using Yices as it is the default solver for JKind and is close to Z3 in terms of computation time.  For 19 models, \bfalg times out after 1 hour.   Figure~\ref{fig:runtimeall} shows the overhead of \bfalg in comparison to \ucalg with multiple solvers.

\takeaway{The brute-force algorithm \bfalg adds a substantial performance penalty to inductive proofs in all cases and is not scalable enough to compute a minimal core for large analysis problems.}

Finally, we consider the combined \ucbfalg algorithm, in which we
first run the \ucalg to determine a close-to-minimal IVC, then run
\bfalg on the remaining set. The overhead of this algorithm is
considered in Tables~\ref{tab:runtime-ucbfalg}
and~\ref{tab:overhead-ucbfalg}. While considerably slower than \ucalg,
this approach can still be used for reasonably sized models.

\subsection{Minimality}
\label{sec:minimality}
In this section, we examine the minimality of the cores computed by
the \ucalg\ and \ucbfalg\ algorithms using different inductive proof methods, and we compare both algorithms against a {\em backward static slice}~\cite{Tip95asurvey} of the Lustre program starting with the property of interest.
There are three interesting aspects to be examined
related to this research question.  First (\textbf{RQ2.1}), does the
choice of SMT solver or algorithm used to produce a proof
($k$-induction or PDR) matter in terms of the minimality of the
inductive core?  As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:ivc}, the \ucalg
algorithm is not guaranteed to produce a minimal core due in part to
the role of invariants used in producing a proof; as $k$-induction and
PDR use substantially different invariant generation algorithms, it is
likely that the set of necessary invariants for proofs are dissimilar,
and that this would in turn affect the number of model elements required for
the proof.  It is possible that one or the other algorithm is more likely
to yield smaller invariant sets.  In addition, differences in the choice of the
UNSAT core algorithms in the different solvers could affect the size of the
generated core. However, our algorithm already performs a minimization
step on UNSAT cores, and thus the only differences would be due to one
algorithm leading to a different minimal core than another.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:experiment}, $k$-induction is unable to solve all of the analysis problems; therefore we include only models that are solvable using {\em both} $k$-induction and PDR by {\em all solvers}, 304 models in all.  Examining the aggregate data in Table~\ref{tab:minimality-algorithm-solvers}, we can see the sizes of cores produced by different algorithms and solvers.

%if we sum all elements of all cores together, that PDR has an smaller core size in aggregate than $k$-induction.
%However, the data is noisy, and to examine \textbf{RQ2.1} systematically, we construct a hypothesis that PDR will, in general, equal or outperform $k$-induction on an arbitrary model:

%\mike{ADD HYPOTHESIS/NULL HYPOTHESIS HERE}

%Although the aggregate data suggests that PDR will yield a smaller core (on average) than $k$-induction, this claim is not supported for a given model with significance.

\takeaway{Neither PDR nor $k$-induction yields a smaller inductive
  validity core in general. The choice of underlying SMT solver does
  not substantially affect the size of the inductive validity cores.}


%we already perform a linear scan of the cores generated by the SMT solver to remove unnecessary conjuncts

The next question (\textbf{RQ2.2}) asks how close to minimal are the
cores produced by \ucalg vs.\ the (guaranteed minimal) cores produced
by the \ucbfalg algorithm? Note that we cannot measure the distance on
all models because the combined algorithm times out on 9 of the larger
models. We therefore examine the distance from minimal cores produced
by the combined algorithm for models in which it completes within the
one hour timeout. For comparison, we run the \ucalg algorithm using Z3
and Yices with JKind's default {\em fastest} algorithm, which will use the
result of either $k$-induction or PDR. A graph showing the size of the
IVCs for each model produced using the Yices solver is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:minimality-all}. In the figure, the models are ranked
along the x-axis by the size of the core produced by \ucbfalg. The
figure demonstrates that while on average there is a modest change in
minimality, there can be substantial variance on the sizes of the
cores produced by the \ucalg algorithm. Summary statistics are shown
in Table~\ref{tab:increase-ucalg-ucbfalg}.

\takeaway{The \ucalg algorithm computes cores that are on average 21\%
  larger than those produced by \ucbfalg, with substantial variance in
  some cases.}

The final question (\textbf{RQ2.3}) asks how well the approach compares to {\em backwards static slicing}~\cite{Tip95asurvey}, since slicing also reduces the set of model elements necessary to construct a proof.  We start the slice from the equation defining the property of interest, and use the usual approach~\cite{Gaucher03:slicing} that performs an iterative backward traversal from the variables used within an equation to their defining equations.  We expect the IVC mechanism to be more precise, because the slice overapproximates of the set of equations necessary for {\em any} proof.  This claim is demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:minimality-all}; slices are (mean) 406\% larger than the IVCs produced by our \ucalg algorithm and 465\% larger than those produced by \ucbfalg algorithm.

\takeaway{Both IVC algorithms compute cores that are usually much smaller than backwards static slices.}

Comparing the sizes of the \ucalg IVCs to the original models, the original 395 benchmark models from~\cite{Hagen08:FMCAD} already had applied slicing, so there is no difference between the sliced size and the original model size.  For the remaining 81 benchmarks, the number of equations is (mean) 2500\% larger than the \ucalg\ IVCs.  We note, however, that comparison of IVC size against the original model size can be misleading, as the improvement can easily be ``gamed'' by adding equations that are irrelevant to the property. %    For this reason, we prefer comparison to the sliced models.
%It should be mention that some of the benchmark models come \emph{pre-sliced}, but for those that are not, the number of equations is (mean) 2500\% larger than the \ucalg IVCs. Figure~\ref{fig:minimality-all} compares the sliced sizes with the IVCs.



\iffalse
\ela{I think this is not needed: \\In terms of size, we calculated the size of the biggest and smallest sets per model, then added them together for all models. The same calculation has been done for \texttt{JSupport}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $A\_JS$: the aggregate number of elements in support sets computed by \texttt{JSupport} = 3078
  \item $A\_Ss$: the aggregate number of elements in the \emph{smallest} support sets = 3474;
  this implies $A\_Ss$ is 12\% greater than $A\_JS$.
  \item $A\_Bs$: the aggregate number of elements in the \emph{biggest} support sets = 3586;
  this implies $A\_Bs$ is 16\% greater than $A\_JS$.
\end{itemize}}
Average size of sets computed by \texttt{ReduceSupport} is 8.55. And, average size of sets computed by \texttt{JSupport} is 7.60. Therefore, in average, support sets computed by \texttt{ReduceSupport} are 88\% close to minimal, in terms of their size.  %  (1 - ((8.55 - 7.6)/ 7.6))  * 100 = 87.5%
Since \texttt{JSupport}, with a great percentage, most of the time computed the smallest support set, we compared the size of the sets computed by \texttt{ReduceSupport} with \texttt{JSupport}. For each configuration, we collected the difference between its support size and \texttt{JSupport} per model. Table~\ref{tab:minimality} shows the result of analysis.

\subsection{Diversity}
\label{sec:diversity}

%% \andrew{We talk a lot about minimality here, but we are computing
%%   jaccard distance among the sets returned by \ucalg which does not
%%   guarantee minimality.}

%% \ela{That's right. we also had a definition/ table of overall distance
%%   based on the minimal pattern. but Maybe this one could show how much
%%   diversity exists between sets. They don't have to be minimal. but,
%%   we wanted to know how similar they are...}

Recall from Section~\ref{sec:ivc} that a {\em minimal}
%\ela{I think using \emph{a core} to refer to a set of cores could be confusing}
IVC set is any set leading to a proof such that if you remove any of
its elements, it no longer produces a proof. For certain models and
properties, it is possible that there are many minimal cores that will
lead to a proof. In this section, we examine the issue of diversity:
do different solvers and algorithms lead to {\em different} minimal
cores? This is both a function of the models and the solution
algorithms: for certain models, there is only one possible minimal IVC
set, whereas other models might have many. Given that there are
multiple solutions, the interesting question is whether using
different solvers and algorithms will lead to different solutions.
The reason diversity is considered is that it has substantial relevance to
some of the uses of the tool, e.g., for constructing multiple traceability
matrices from proofs (see Section~\ref{sec:conc}).  
Note that our exploration in this experiment is not 
exhaustive, but only exploratory, based on the IVCs returned by different
algorithms and tools; we leave exhaustive exploration of 
IVCs for future work.

%Given diversity of results, we may wish to
%distinguish {\em must} traceability elements from {\em may}
%traceability elements across a set of diverse solutions, and consider
%more systematic explorations of diversity in future work.

To measure diversity of IVCs, we use Jaccard distance:
\begin{definition}{\emph{Jaccard distance:}}
  \label{def:dj}
  $d_J(\small{A}, \small{B}) = 1 - \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|} ,\\ 0 \leq d_J(\small{A}, \small{B}) \leq 1$
\end{definition}
\noindent Jaccard distance is a standard metric for comparing finite
sets (assuming that both sets are non-empty) by comparing the size of
the intersection of two sets over its union. For each model in the
benchmark, the experiments generated 13 potentially different IVCs. Therefore, we
obtained $\binom{13}{2} = 78$ combinations of pairwise distances per
model. Then, minimum, maximum, average, and standard deviation of the
distances were calculated (Figure~\ref{fig:jacdis}), by which, again,
we calculated these four measures among all models. As seen in
Table~\ref{tab:jaccard-avg}, on average, the Jaccard distance between
different solutions is small, but the maximum is close to 1, which
indicates that even for our exploratory analysis, there are models for
which the tools yield substantially diverse solutions. The diversity
between solutions is represented graphically in
Figure~\ref{fig:jacdis}, where for each model, we present the min,
max, and mean pairwise Jaccard distance of the solutions produced by algorithm
\ucalg for each model, ranked by the mean distance.

\iffalse
\mike{Do we want the discussion below?  I am not sure that it adds much}

To measure the overall similarity among all sets, instead of a pairwise comparison, we used \emph{frequent pattern mining} \cite{han2007frequent}. To define an overall similarity among all sets of support of a given model\footnote{Note that all models in the benchmarks are single property; hence, instead of saying a set of support of a given \emph{property}, we just refer it as the support set of the \emph{model} while explaining the experimental results.}, we calculated a \emph{core} support set for each model in the benchmark, which can be considered as a closed frequent pattern; a core set of model $M$, denoted by $C_M$, is defined as:
\begin{definition}
  \label{def:core}
  $C_M = \bigcap_{i=1}^{13} s_{Mi},   \hspace{9pt} s_{Mi} \in S_M$
\end{definition}

Based on this notion, overall dissimilarity, denoted by $D_{J\{M\}}$, is defined as follows:

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:dis}
  $D_{J\{M\}} =  \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{12}d_J(s_{Mi}, C_M)}{12},   \hspace{9pt} s_{Mi} \in S_M$
\end{definition}

Since our goal is to measure the diversity or dissimilarity among sets computed by \texttt{ReduceSupport}, in \ref{def:dis}, we exclude the set generated by \texttt{JSupport}. In Fig~\ref{fig:jacdis}, the \emph{overall distance} line shows $D_{J\{M\}}$ per model, which can be analyzed from the following hypotheses:
\begin{itemize}
  \item H0: variety of obtained sets of support is high (average $D_{J\{M\}}$ of 0.2)
  \item H1: variety of obtained sets of support is small (average $D_{J\{M\}}$ less than 0.2)
\end{itemize}
Table~\ref{tab:variety} shows that, with an effect size of 0.79, H0 can be rejected.

\subsection{Discussion}

In the previous section, we presented three algorithms for determining
inductive validity cores. The brute-force algorithm is guaranteed
minimal, but is often very slow. The other two algorithms, the UNSAT
core algorithm \ucalg and the combined algorithm \ucbfalg, represent
interesting trade-offs. The \ucalg algorithm is much faster, but is
not guaranteed to be minimal; the result of this algorithm can be
further, and sometimes quickly, refined by the combined algorithm.
Thus, we can choose to trade off speed for guaranteed minimality using
these two algorithms; the combined algorithm can be viewed as a
refinement algorithm that we can terminate either at completion or
after a fixed time bound.


%One question that arises is: why is the refinement so much quicker than the brute-force approach?  In our preliminary examination, it appears to be because of the actions performed by JKind on the sub-problems.  When the cores produced by \ucalg\ are minimal or close to minimal, it tends to be the case that removing conjuncts from the core leads to short counterexamples.  When performing the brute-force algorithm, removing the irrelevant pieces of the model require repeated proof search.

Although our experiment does not ask statistical questions, it is still worth examining threats towards generalizing our results.  First, are the models and properties that we chose representative?  We started from an existing benchmark from another research group suite to try to assuage this concern, but most of these models were small, so we extended the benchmark suite with 81 of our own models.  It is possible that our additions skew the results, though these models are immediately derived from previously published work and not modified for our analysis here.  Second, our models and tools use the Lustre language, which is equational, rather than conjuncted transition systems; it is possible (though, in our opinion, unlikely) that arbitrary conjuncts rather than equations will yield different performance or minimality characteristics.

Our approach is limited by the capabilities of the SMT solvers and inductive model checking algorithms that are used.  For example, it is difficult, given state of the art SMT solvers, to produce proofs involving complex models involving non-linear floating-point arithmetic.  However, given an inductive proof produced by an UNSAT-core-producing SMT solver, we feel confident that the \ucalg\ algorithm can produce an IVC.  Our approach is theory and invariant-generator agnostic, so as inductive model checking algorithms evolve and SMT solvers add support for new theories, the IVC algorithm should be able to work without modification.
