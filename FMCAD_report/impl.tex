\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:impl}

We have implemented our technique in JKind \cite{jkind}, as precisely described in \cite{Ghass16}. JKind is an infinite-state model checker for safety properties. It proves safety properties using multiple cooperative engines in parallel including k-induction, PDR, and template-based lemma generation. JKind accepts
Lustre programs written over the theory of linear integer and real
arithmetic. In the back-end, JKind uses an SMT solver such as
Z3, Yices, MathSAT, or SMTInterpol.
JKind works on multiple properties simultaneously. When a
property is proven and IVC generation is enabled, an additional
parallel engine executes the IVC generation algorithm to compute a minimal
IVC. In order to benchmark, we designed an experiment from a suite Lustre models developed
as a benchmark suite for~\cite{Hagen08:FMCAD} and augmented with additional models from industrial projects like~\cite{QFCS15:backes,hilt2013}. The results show that our algorithm for computing IVCs is quite efficient even for industrial models with an average overhead of ~10\%.
