\section{Conclusions \& Future Work}
\label{sec:conc}
The idea of extracting a minimal IVC of a given
specification has been recently introduced in \cite{Ghass16} with a lot of useful applications in different phases of system development \cite{Ghass16, Murugesan16:renext}.
In this paper, we have addressed the problem of extracting all minimal IVCs. We have shown
the correctness and completeness of our method and algorithm.
The experimental evaluation shows that our method is as fast as finding a single
 minimal IVC by the \ucbfalg ~algorithm proposed in \cite{Ghass16}.

 Our method is inspired by a recent work in the domain of satisfiability analysis \cite{marco2016fast}. One interesting future direction is to devise similar IVC enumeration algorithms based on other studies on MUSes extraction such as \cite{Bacchus2016, nadel2014accelerated}.
 We are also looking into improving our implementation by using more
 efficient methods for the \isadeq ~and \getivc ~modules used by our algorithm.
 Another interesting direction is to parallelize the enumeration process.
 We are also interested in adapting the notion of (all) Validity Cores for bounded model checking.
