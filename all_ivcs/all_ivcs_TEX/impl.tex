\section{Implementation and Evaluation}
\label{sec:impl}

We have implemented the \aivcalg ~algorithm
in an industrial model checker called \texttt{JKind} ~\cite{jkind},
which is for verifying safety properties of  infinite-state synchronous systems.
It accepts Lustre programs \cite{Halbwachs91:lustre}
written over the theory of linear integer and real arithmetic.
Verification is based on k-induction and property directed reachability (PDR) using a back-end SMT solver.
In the
back-end, \texttt{JKind} supports \texttt{Z3}~\cite{DeMoura08:z3},
\texttt{Yices}~\cite{Dutertre06:yices}, \texttt{MathSAT}~\cite{Cimatti2013:MathSAT},
\texttt{SMTInterpol}~\cite{Christ2012:SMTInterpol}, and \texttt{CVC4} \cite{barrett2011cvc4}. \texttt{JKind} is a multi-engine model checker that works on multiple properties simultaneously. When a property is
proven and IVC generation is enabled, an additional parallel engine
executes the \ucalg ~algorithm \cite{Ghass16} to generate an (approximately) minimal IVC. To implement our method, we have made use of this engine and also extended \texttt{JKind} with a new engine that
implements Algorithm \ref{alg:aivc} on top of \texttt{Z3}.
The source code is publicly available on \cite{mygit}.

%This section points out some technical issues in the implementation.

%We have extended \texttt{JKind} with a new engine that
% implements Algorithm \ref{alg:aivc}.
% First a property is proved and a single IVC set $S$ is computed
% by the IVC generation engine. Then, the set $S$ is sent to our engine.
% For efficiency, instead of initializing $map$ with $\top$,
% we initialize $map$ with $\bigvee_{T_{i}\in S} \neg {\actlit (T_i)}$,
% which prunes off set $S$ and all its supersets from $\mathcal{P}(T)$ at the beginning of the algorithm. If $S$ is minimal, then chances are a large
% subset of  $\mathcal{P}(T)$ is marked as explored even before
% the algorithm starts the search.
