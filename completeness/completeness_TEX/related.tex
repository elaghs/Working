WILL BE FIXED LATER: THESE ARE JUST SOME NOTES FOR MYSELF!\\IGNORE THIS SECTION FOR NOW...

\cite{claessen2007coverage}:
they try to address the same question of do we have enough properties in hardware design and circuit verification.
In the formal verification context, there are several notions of coverage that try to address how much of the design was needed in the formal proof? \cite{chockler2006coverage, chockler_coverage_2003, katz1999have, grosse2007estimating}.
 "One disadvantage of these methods is that they
include the actual design in the coverage analysis." why???
their definition of coverage: Given a set of properties and if there is a path where there exists a point in time when a particular output is not constrained by any properties.
