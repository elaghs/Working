\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Overview of the problem: sequential model checkers do not provide much insight into proofs.
    \item Section should roughly follow the structure of "Finding Minimal Unsatisfiable Cores of
        Declarative Specifications" paper by Torlak et al (with Dan Jackson).
    \item UNSAT Cores have been used for a variety of analysis tasks
    \item we want to generalize this idea for sequential systems
\end{itemize}
