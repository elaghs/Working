Given a transition system that satisfies a safety property $P$, we
want to know which parts of the system are necessary for satisfying
the safety property. One possible way of asking this is, ``What is the
most general version of this transition system that still satisfies
the property?'' The answer is disappointing. The most general system is
$I(u) = P(u)$ and $T(u, u') = P(u')$, i.e., you start in any state
satisfying the property and can transition to any state that still
satisfies the property. This answer gives no insight into the original
system because it has no connection to the original system. In this
section we introduce the notion of {\em inductive validity core} (IVC)
which looks at generalizing the original transition system while
preserving a safety property.

We assume the transition relation has the structure of a top-level conjunction.  Given $T(u, u') = T_1(u, u') \land \cdots \land T_n(u, u')$ we will write $T = \bigwedge_{i=1..n}T_i$ for short.
By further abuse of notation,
$T$ is identified with the set of its top-level conjuncts. Thus, $T_i \in
T$ means that $T_i$ is a top-level conjunct of $T$, and $S
\subseteq T$ means all top-level conjuncts of $S$ are top-level
conjuncts of $T$. When a top-level conjunct $T_i$ is removed from $T$, we write $T \setminus \{T_i\}$. Such a transition system can easily encode our example model in Section~\ref{sec:example}, where each equation defines a conjunct within $T$ that we will denote by the variable assigned; so, $T = \{$ {\small \texttt{a1\_below, a2\_below, a1\_above, a2\_above, below, above\_hyst, doi\_on, d1, d2}} $\}$.

\begin{definition}{\emph{Inductive Validity Core (\ivc):}}
  \label{def:ivc}
  Let $(I, T)$ be a transition system and let $P$ be a
  safety property with $(I, T)\vdash P$.
  We say $S \subseteq T$ for $(I, T)\vdash P$ is an Inductive Validity Core,
  denoted by $\ivc(P, S)$, iff $(I, S) \vdash P $.
  When $I$, $T$, and $P$ can be inferred from
  context we will simply say $S$ is an inductive validity core.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{\emph{Minimal Inductive Validity Core (\mivc):}}
  \label{def:minimal-ivc}
  $S \subseteq T$ is a minimal Inductive Validity Core,
  denoted by $\mivc(P, S)$, iff ~
  $\ivc(P, S) \wedge \forall T_i \in S.~ (I, S\setminus\{ T_i \}) \nvdash P$.
\end{definition}

Note that, given $(I, T) \vdash P$, $P$ always has at least one \mivc, and it may also have many distinct {\mivc}s corresponding to different proof paths. To capture the latter, the \emph{all {\mivc}s ($\aivc$)} relation has been introduced in \cite{Murugesan16:renext}.
\begin{definition}{\emph{All {\mivc}s ($\aivc$):}}
    \label{def:allivcs}
    Given $(I, T) \vdash P$, $\aivc(P)$ is the set of all \mivc s for $P$:
    $$ \aivc(P) \equiv  \{\ S~|~S \subseteq T \land  MIVC(P, S)\} $$
\end{definition}

Inductive validity cores have the following monotonicity property.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:ivc-monotonic}
  Let $(I, T)$ be a transition system and let $P$ be a safety property
  with $(I, T)\vdash P$. Let $S_1 \subseteq S_2 \subseteq T$. If $S_1$
  is an inductive validity core for $(I, T)\vdash P$ then $S_2$ is an
  inductive validity core for $(I, T)\vdash P$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  From $S_1 \subseteq S_2$ we have $S_2 \Rightarrow S_1$. Thus the
  reachable states of $(I, S_2)$ are a subset of the reachable states
  of $(I, S_1)$.
\end{proof}

Fig.~\ref{fig:ivcs} illustrates these notions by a graphical representation of minimal IVCs for property $P = ({\small{\texttt{on\_p}}})$ in the example presented in Section~\ref{sec:example}. As shown in the picture, this property has two distinct \mivc s, which means the model satisfies $P$ in two different ways:  {\small \texttt{\{\{a1\_below, below, doi\_on\}, \{a2\_below, below, doi\_on\}\}}}, This is because in the implementation, the DOI is turned on when either of the altimeters is below the threshold, while our property states that they both must be below.
Note that there is a subset of model elements, $\{{\small \texttt{a1\_above, a2\_above, above\_hyst, d1, d2}}\}$, that does not show up in $\aivc(P)$. Elements in such a subset
do not affect the satisfaction of $P$.  For comparison, note that a backwards static slice starting from {\small{\texttt{on\_p}}} will include the entire model.
%In the complete ASW model in~\cite{HCW02:ase-deviation} there are additional properties that use these elements, but they are not necessary for the discussion in this paper.

  with  $P = ({\small \texttt{on\_p}})$}

\end{figure}

%Distinct IVCs may have common elements, and the intersection of all \mivc s is called the \emph{must} set for $P$.

Generally, an IVC computation technique aims to determine, for any subset $S \subseteq T$, whether $P$ is provable by $S$. Then, a minimal subset that satisfies $P$ is seen as a minimal proof explanation called a minimal Inductive Validity Core.
