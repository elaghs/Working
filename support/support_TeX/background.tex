\subsection{Transition Systems and Safety Properties}

Given a state space $S$, a transition system $(I,T)$ consists of an
initial state predicate $I : S \to \bool$ and a transition step
predicate $T : S \times S \to \bool$. We define the notion of
reachability for $(I, T)$ as a the smallest predicate $\reach : S \to
\bool$ which satisfies the following formulas:
\begin{equation*}
  \forall s.~ I(s) \Rightarrow \reach(s)
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
  \forall s, s'.~ \reach(s) \land T(s, s') \Rightarrow \reach(s')
\end{equation*}
When the transition system is not obvious from context we will write
$\reach_{(I,T)}$ for the reachability predicate on the transition
system $(I,T)$.

A safety property $P : S \to \bool$ is a state predicate. A safety
property $P$ holds on a transition system $(I, T)$ if it holds on all
reachable states, i.e., $\forall s.~ \reach(s) \Rightarrow P(s)$,
written as $\reach \Rightarrow P$ for short.

For an arbitrary transition system $(I, T)$, computing reachability
can be very expensive or even impossible. Thus, we need a more
effective way of checking if a safety property $P$ is satisfied by the
system. The key idea is to over-approximate reachability. If we can
find an over-approximation that implies the property, then the
property must hold. Otherwise, the approximation needs to be refined.

A good first approximation for reachability is the property itself.
That is, we can check if the following formulas hold:
\begin{equation}
  \forall s.~ I(s) \Rightarrow P(s)
  \label{eq:1-ind-base}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \forall s, s'.~ P(s) \land T(s, s') \Rightarrow P(s')
  \label{eq:1-ind-step}
\end{equation}
If both formulas hold then $P$ is {\em inductive} and holds over the
system. If (\ref{eq:1-ind-base}) fails to hold, then $P$ is violated
by an initial state of the system. If (\ref{eq:1-ind-step}) fails to
hold, then $P$ is too much of an over-approximation and needs to be
refined.

One way to refine our over-approximation is to add additional lemmas
to the property of interest. For example, given another property $L :
S \to bool$ we can consider the extended property $P'(s) = P(s) \land
L(s)$, written as $P' = P \land L$ for short. If $P'$ holds on the
system, then $P$ must hold as well. The hope is that the addition of
$L$ makes formula (\ref{eq:1-ind-step}) provable because the
antecedent is more constrained. However, the consequent of
(\ref{eq:1-ind-step}) is also more constrained, so the lemma $L$ may
require additional lemmas of its own.

Another way to refine our over-approximation is to use use {\em
  $k$-induction} which to unrolls the property over $k$ steps of the
transition system. For example, 1-induction consists of formulas
(\ref{eq:1-ind-base}) and (\ref{eq:1-ind-step}) above, whereas
2-induction consists of the following formulas:
\begin{align*}
  \forall s.~ I(s) \Rightarrow P(s)
&&  \forall s, s'.~ I(s) \land T(s, s') \Rightarrow P(s')
\end{align*}
\begin{equation*}
  \forall s, s', s''.~ P(s) \land T(s, s') \land P(s') \land T(s', s'')  \Rightarrow P(s'')
\end{equation*}
That is, there are two base step checks and one inductive step check.
In general, for an arbitrary $k$, $k$-induction consists of the $k$
base step checks and one inductive step check as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:k-induction}. We say that a property is $k$-inductive
if it satisfies the $k$-induction constraints for a the given value of
$k$. The hope is that the additional formulas in the antecedent of
the inductive step make it provable.

\begin{figure}
\begin{equation*}
  \forall s_0.~ I(s_0) \Rightarrow P(s_0)
\end{equation*}
\begin{center}
$\vdots$
\end{center}
\begin{equation*}
  \forall s_0, \ldots, s_{k-1}.~ I(s_0) \land T(s_0, s_1) \land \cdots
  \land T(s_{k-2}, s_{k-1}) \Rightarrow P(s_{k-1})
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
  \forall s_0, \ldots, s_k.~ P(s_0) \land T(s_0, s_1) \land P(s_{k-1})
  \land T(s_{k-1}, s_k) \Rightarrow P(s_k)
\end{equation*}
\caption{$k$-induction formulas: $k$ base cases and one inductive
  step}
\label{fig:k-induction}
\end{figure}

In practice, we often use a combination of the above techniques. Thus,
a typical conclusion is of the form ``$P$ with lemmas $L_1, \ldots, L_n$
is $k$-inductive''.

\subsection{JKind and Lustre}
\label{subsec:jkind}
\andrew{AJG: I think we should move this section to implementation.
  We can cut it down and also talk about what set-of-support means in
  Lustre vs general transition systems.}

JKind is an infinite-state model checker for safety properties. JKind
proves safety properties using multiple cooperative engines in
parallel including $k$-induction, property directed reachability
(PDR), and template-based lemma generation. JKind operates over
expressions in the theory of linear integer and real arithmetic. In
the back-end, JKind uses an SMT-solver such as Yices, Z3, CVC4,
MathSAT, or SMTInterpol.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{verbatim}
node main(x : int) returns (r : int; ok : bool);
let
  r = (0 -> pre r) + (if x > 0 then x else -x);
  ok = (r >= 0);
tel;
\end{verbatim}
  \caption{Example Lustre program}
  \label{fig:lustre-ex}
\end{figure}

The input language to JKind is Lustre, a synchronous dataflow language.
An example Lustre program is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lustre-ex}. For
our purposes, a Lustre program consists of 1) some input variables,
{\tt x} in the example, 2) some output variables, {\tt r} and {\tt ok}
in the example, and 3) an equation for each output variable. A Lustre
program runs over discrete time steps. On each step, the input
variables take on some values and are used to compute values for the
output variables on the same step. In addition, equations may refer to
the previous value of a variable using the {\tt pre} operator. This
operator is undefined in the initial step, so the arrow operator, {\tt
  ->}, is used to guard such the {\tt pre} operator. In the initial
step the expression {\tt e1 -> e2} reduces to {\tt e1}, and it
reduces to {\tt e2} in all other steps.

We interpret a Lustre program as a model specification by considering
the behavior of the program under all possible input traces. Safety
properties over Lustre can then be expressed as Boolean output
variables in Lustre. A safety property holds if the corresponding
Boolean output variable is always true for all input traces. For
example, the program in Figure~\ref{fig:lustre-ex} represents an
integrator over the absolute value of the input variable. The output
variable {\tt ok} is a safety property of the system expressing that
the computed result is always non-negative. In this case, the property
is true.

It is easy to translate this interpretation of Lustre into the
traditional initial and transition relations. We will show this by
example using Figure~\ref{fig:lustre-ex}. First we introduce a new Boolean
variable $init$ into the state space to denote when the system is in
its initial step. Then we define,
\begin{align*}
  &I((x, r, \mathit{ok}, \mathit{init})) = \mathit{init} \\
  &T((x, r, \mathit{ok}, \mathit{init}), (x', r', \mathit{ok'},
  \mathit{init'})) = \\
  &\hspace{1cm} (r' = (\ite{init}{0}{r})) \land (\mathit{ok'} =
  (r' \geq 0)) \land \neg\mathit{init'}
\end{align*}
Each equation in the Lustre program is translated into a conjunct in
the transition relation. A safety property such as {\tt ok} is
translated into $\mathit{init} \lor \mathit{ok}$. Nested uses of arrow
and pre operators are handled by introducing new output variables for
nested expressions, though such details are unimportant for our
purposes.
