# instructions:
# 1- in the current directory, wherever you have this script, create a folder under the name of benchmarks
# 2- copy all of the .lus models in the benchmarks folder
#    --> you need to get the polished benchmarks from here: 
#            https://github.com/elaghs/Working/blob/master/support/experiments/polished_benchmark/polished_benchmarks.zip
#    --> make sure you DON'T change the directory to the benchmarks folder. 
#    --> stay in the current directory, NOT in the benchmarks
# 3- get the latest jkind .jar files from here: https://github.com/elaghs/jkind/tree/support-paper/JAR-files
# 4- install jkind and set the path for it.
#    --> in Linux you should use the environment variable "JKIND_HOME" for it
#    --> in Windows you can put it in "path"
# 5- don't forget to install all the solvers that jkind needs (especially, z3, yices, mathsat)

# Here is the order that scripts should be run:
# 1- exprm1.py, exprm2.py
# 2- result_mining1.py
# 3- result_mining2.py
# 4- support_analyzer.py
# 5- support_reporter.py
# 6- time_analyzer.py
