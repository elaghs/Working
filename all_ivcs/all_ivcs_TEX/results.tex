In this section, we examine our experimental results to address the research questions defined in the experiment.

\subsubsection{RQ1:} 

To address RQ1, we measured the performance overhead of the various IVC algorithms against the baseline time
necessary to find a proof using inductive model checking. Fig. \ref{fig:performance} provides an overview of the  overhead of the \aivcalg ~algorithm in comparison to the \ucalg ~and \ucbfalg\ algorithms.  In the figure, each curve is ranked along the x-axis according to the time required for the algorithm to terminate for each analysis problem.  Table \ref{tab:runtime} provides a summary of the computation time and the overhead of different algorithms.  As is evidenced by Fig. \ref{fig:performance}, the \ucalg\  algorithm imposes a negligible overhead over the baseline proof time, whereas both the \ucbfalg\ algorithm and \aivcalg\ algorithms add a substantial penalty over the baseline proof time.  We examine the performance of the \aivcalg\ algorithm both in terms of the time required to find all IVCs and also the time required divided by the number of IVCs found.  Somewhat surprisingly, for the majority of models, the latter measure outperforms the \ucbfalg\ algorithm for the majority of the models in the benchmark suite.

The \aivcalg\ algorithm requires approximately 3.4x more time than the \ucbfalg\ algorithm, calculated in the following way: we measure the ratio of time required for each model for both metrics, then we take the mean of this ratio for all models.  It is important to note that these performance curves are sensitive to the timeout values chosen for individual proof-searches for IVCs (the \getivc\ step in \aivcalg\ and line 3 in the ``brute force'' algorithm in~\cite{Ghass16}).  This aspect will be discussed in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:experiment-discussion}.

%The \aivcalg ~algorithm could have had better (worse) performance
% if timeout had been set lower (higher), which caused the average runtime (overhead) of the \aivcalg ~shown in Table \ref{tab:runtime} (Table \ref{tab:overhead}) to be $\thicksim 3$ times more than \ucbfalg .

\subsubsection{RQ2:} For this research question, we examine how the proof time of the original model and the number of MIVCs associated with the property affects the analysis time of the \aivcalg\ algorithm.  Figure~\ref{fig:modelsize} provides an overview of this data.  The data in Figure~\ref{fig:modelsize} is sorted twice along the x-axis: the major axis is the number of MIVCs that exist for the model, and the minor axis is the analysis time of the baseline model.  In this graph, we can visualize how both factors effect the performance of the \aivcalg\ algorithm.  Note that there are two scales for the y-axis: the scale on the left is a logarithmic scale of performance in terms of the run time; the scale on the right is a linear scale based on the number of minimal IVCs discovered.

Figure~\ref{fig:modelsize} shows two distinct trends.  First, for models whose baseline proofs are inexpensive and that only have a single MIVC, the \aivcalg\ is roughly equivalent in performance to the \ucbfalg.  However, as proofs become more expensive for a single MIVC, the \aivcalg\ begins to underperform the \ucbfalg.  This trend becomes more pronounced for properties that yield multiple MIVCs.  In the cases where several MIVCs are found, the \aivcalg\ algorithm can underperform the \ucbfalg\ algorithm by an order of magnitude.  Thus, the performance of the \aivcalg\ is driven to a large degree by the number of minimal inductive validity cores that exist for the model.


%The structure of the model and specification can play a part in how well \aivcalg ~performs.
%Therefore, we would like to examine whether or not there is a relationship between the performance and the size of the model, proof-time, and the diversity of IVCs. A graph showing the size of each model (determined by the number of equations in the model) and the number of IVCs
% along with the running time of \aivcalg ~and normal verification time is shown in Fig \ref{fig:modelsize}. In the figure, the models are ranked along the x-axis by their size. The picture shows that as models get larger, it is more likely for the \aivcalg ~algorithm to take more time to complete. However, there is no straightforward relationship between the performance and the number of IVCs. It can be expected that the running time of the \aivcalg ~algorithm goes higher when verification takes more time.

%\ela{do we want this table 3? I commented the table description in case you want to use it...}
%Table \ref{tab:ivcsize} compares
%the  minimum,  maximum,  average,
%and standard deviation of the size of the IVCs computed by the different algorithms.
%For the \aivcalg ~algorithm, the  minimum,  maximum,  average,
%and standard deviation of the size of the IVCs per model is calculated, and then again, these four measures are calculated among all models.
%As for the \texttt{minimum IVC} row, the four measures are calculated among the size of the minimum IVC generated by \aivcalg ~for each model.
%The size of IVCs computed by \ucalg ~and \ucbfalg ~are quite close to each other. It means the \ucalg ~algorithm computes IVCs that are very close to the minimal ones obtained from the \ucbfalg , which makes the \ucalg ~algorithm a reasonable choice for the \getivc ~procedure in Algorithm \ref{alg:aivc}
%although it does not guarantee minimality.
%Fig. \ref{fig:ratio} also demonstrates that average cost of \aivcalg ~per IVC is very close to average cost of finding one IVC by \ucbfalg. Given the fact that the size of IVCs generated by \ucalg ~is very close to the ones generated by \ucbfalg, makes the \ucalg ~algorithm
%more efficient for the \getivc ~procedure.

\subsection {Discussion}
\label{sec:experiment-discussion}
%\ela{rewrite...\\}
The experiment demonstrates that for most of the example models, finding all minimal IVCs is within the same ballpark as finding a single minimal IVC in terms of computation time.  However, these results are dependent on the number of minimal IVCs that are associated with the property: the more MIVCs associated with a property, the higher the expense of \aivcalg\ as compared to the \ucbfalg\ algorithm.  

An important aspect of the performance comparison involves the timeout value chosen for individual IVC computations performed by \getivc\ within the \aivcalg\ algorithm and also the behavior of the SMT solvers with different sets of activation literals.  Each time we call \getivc\ we attempt to do a ``fresh'' proof from a new set of activation literals.  As we approach minimal IVCs, these proofs can become substantially harder for the solver to determine than the original proof, often involving more lemmas for information that was originally present in the model.  Thus, for complex models, it often happens that we reach the `timeout' case in both the \aivcalg\ and \ucbfalg\ algorithms, which may cause both algorithms to reject valid IVC solutions that are smaller than what is reported as a minimal IVCs, since both algorithms treat timeout-as-failure.  We have empirically set timeout values for a given proof search to 60 seconds + 10 $*$ {\em proof-time} for the initial proof over the whole model. Our timeout threshold is somewhat arbitrary, and it is likely that the performance and minimality results would change if a different threshold was chosen.

Worse, because the \ucbfalg\ and \aivcalg\ algorithms submit different profiles in terms of activation literals, the solvers sometimes can solve an IVC problem for one algorithm but not the other.  This leads to some cases where the \ucbfalg\ algorithm finds a {\em smaller} IVC than the \aivcalg\ algorithm, because the \aivcalg\ algorithm times out attempting to find a MIVC that was found by the \ucbfalg.  This is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:min}, where in 14 out of 476 models, \ucbfalg\ finds a smaller MIVC than the minimum IVC found by \aivcalg.  Of course, in many more cases,\mike{Elaheh: how many?}, the \aivcalg\ finds a smaller minimum IVC than the \ucbfalg.

\end{figure}

Although we understand the issue, it is worrisome that different activation literal sets can cause solvers to time out in this way.  In the future, we will examine whether it is possible to eliminate these anomalous cases by different encodings of activation literals.
