              Lustre is a dataflow language that
              provided many of the ideas that were used in the
              formal semantics for RSML-e.  It is a dataflow
              language that describes the interactions of a set of
              {\em nodes} which describe a transformation from a
              set of inputs to a set of outputs, {\em
              variables} which are used as shorthands for
              often used expressions, and {\em clocks} which describe
              when nodes or variables are to be recomputed.

              RSML-e = Lustre + hierarchies + interfaces +
                 slightly more general arrays + built-in time +
                 UNDEFINED values + more elaborate history lists
                 - tuple types - clocks - modules.

              In RSML-e, history information is maintained through value
              traces for all variables.  In other words, we have a
              list of all assignments to each variable since the
              specification began execution.  In Lustre, history
              information is maintained by a special kind of
              expression, PRE, that maintains the value assigned
              to the expression prior to the current execution.
              These expressions are always of the form:
              \[PRE(exp, initial)\]
              \noindent where $exp$ is the expression whose previous value
              is to be found, and $initial$ is the initial value
              of the PRE expression.  Formally, the PRE-histories
              are maintained by {\em changing the syntax}
              of the PRE expression.  So, for example, if a PRE
              expression is:
              \[PRE(exp, initial)\]
              \noindent and the value of $exp$ at evaluation is
              $v$, then the syntax of the program becomes:
              \[PRE(exp, v)\]
              \noindent for the next evaluation.

              Lustre does not have an internal notion of time,
              which is both good and bad, compared to RSML-e.  In
              order to keep track of assignment times or change
              times, it is necessary to add extra variables to a
              Lustre spec.  On the other hand, Lustre does not
              require that the underlying hardware or
              encapsulating C code have a notion of clock time,
              where RSML-e requires it.  Therefore, there may be
              platforms that cannot support certain RSML-e
              specifications because there is no notion of time.
              Most of the time, a clock can be created manually to
              correspond to RSML-e's internal clock.  For example,
              any of the Lustre clocks, represented by MILLISECOND
              signals can be translated into RSML-e time.

              RSML-e does more automatic bookkeeping for the history
              lists for variables than does Lustre, but at the
              cost of being more verbose.  The required size for
              history lists for an RSML-e implementation is
              automatically determined.

              Lustre's concept of variables is much more
              'lightweight' than RSML's.  One only need declare the
              type (int, real, or bool), and declare an assignment
              expression in Lustre.  For RSML-e, you must provide
              units, min/max values, type, parent, and assignment
              relation information.  Also, in Lustre, you can
              group variable assignments by type, like any other
              programming language:
              \begin{verbatim}
               a, b, c: int
              \end{verbatim}
              If we defaulted the PARENT: field to NONE and placed
              the rest of the crap in strong types (containing
              min/max values and units as well as basic type
              information), then we would have similar conciseness
              in declarations.

              Lustre's nodes provide a good example of how we
              should approach modules in RSML-e.  Nodes simply
              have an externally visible interface and local
              variables, much like they would in RSML-e.  Only
              values can be passed through node interfaces, so
              scoping of functions is not a concern.  It is the
              lowest common denominator approach, but it appears
              successful.
