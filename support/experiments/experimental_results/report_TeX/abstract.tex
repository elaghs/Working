The idea of set of support aims to provide evidence and explanation for why a specific property is satisfied by a model. 
This core idea can have a lot of applications in software engineering. However, in order to make use of this idea, we have to inspect efficiency, accuracy, and usability of this notion. After implementation of this notion in the JKind model checker, we came up with some research questions to investigate the applicability of our approach and tool. 

This report provides a detailed description of the conducted experiments and their results. After explaining experimental design and set-up, each section reports some analytical results to answer a particular research question. We provide some technical detail as to how analyze the results.
