\begin{itemize}
    \item Research questions (informally):
    \item \quad RQ1: How much overhead does computation of set of support add to inductive proofs?
    \item \quad RQ2: How stable is the computed set of support given different solvers
        and verification algorithms?
    \item \quad RQ3: How close to minimal is the computed set of support compared to a much slower, but guaranteed minimal approach?
    \item Experimental setup: What did we use for benchmark models?  Where did they come from?  Why is this a good set? 
    \item Tables related to each research question.
