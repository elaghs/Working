A similar notion to ours was outlined in a patent~\cite{hanna2015formal}, which sketches a family of {\em proof core}-based metrics for use in hardware verification.  While the approach described by the patent is general, it is quite underspecified:
no formal description of the models, metrics, or algorithms are provided, nor in fact are any concrete metrics specified. In addition, no implementations or experimental results are provided, so it is not possible to compare their approach and ours. In addition, in commercial hardware verification frameworks do different forms of coverage analysis: Cadence JasperGold~\cite{jasper_gold} does some form of proof core coverage and Synopsys VC Formal~\cite{Synopsys_VC_formal} does a mutation-based coverage approach.  These coverage measurement approaches may be similar to the approaches defined in the paper but are not described in sufficient depth to be compared.
