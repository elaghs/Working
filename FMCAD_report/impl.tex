\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:impl}

The algorithm for efficiently computing IVCs can be found in a forthcoming FSE paper~\cite{Ghass16} and is implemented in the JKind \cite{jkind}, which is an infinite-state model checker for safety properties using multiple cooperative engines in parallel (such as k-induction and PDR). JKind accepts
Lustre programs written over the theory of linear integer and real
arithmetic. In the back-end, JKind uses an SMT solver such as
Z3, Yices, MathSAT, or SMTInterpol.
JKind works on multiple properties simultaneously. When a
property is proven and IVC generation is enabled, an additional
parallel engine executes the IVC generation algorithm to compute a minimal
IVC. We demonstrated the efficiency and precision of the approach using a set of Lustre models developed
as a benchmark suite for~\cite{Hagen08:FMCAD}, augmented with additional models from industrial projects (~\cite{QFCS15:backes,hilt2013}). The results show that our algorithm for computing IVCs is quite efficient even for industrial models with an average overhead of ~10\%.
