\section{Scalability Case Study}

\label{sec:qfc}
The benchmark models from~\cite{expr} are of modest size.  To examine the scalability of our approach for large models, we found one substantially larger model to analyze, a NASA Quad-redundant Flight Control System (QFCS) model from~\cite{NFM2015:backes}. %developed using the AADL AGREE tool suite \cite{NFM2012:CoGa}.
%The QFCS has a hierarchical architecture consisting of several components.
%The monotonic model has 50,635 design elements (LUSTRE equations), 7,719 of which are registers.
For this study we examined two of the model components: the Flight Control System (FCS) (with 3,423 equations, \mike{YYY} integer delays, and 2 properties) and the Flight Control Computers (FCC) (with 9,953 equations, \mike{YYY} integer delays, and 9 properties), running each property separately.  

%We ran the algorithm on each property separately, which left us with 11 complex problems to study.
