\section{Industrial Case Study}

\label{sec:qfc} 
 
This section is to evaluate our technique on a a realistic example from NASA's Transport Class Model (TCM) aircraft simulation model \cite{hueschen2011development}. We use the Quad-redundant Flight Control System (QFCS) model from \cite{NFM2015:backes} developed using \texttt{AADL AGREE}
tool suite \cite{NFM2012:CoGa}. 
The QFCS has a hierarchical architecture consisting of several components. 
The monotonic model has 50,635 design elements (LUSTRE equations), 7,719 of which are registers. 
For this study, due to time limitation, we chose two of the model components: 
the Flight Control Computers (FCC) (with 9,953 design elements 
and 9 properties) and the Flight Control System (FCS) (with 3,423 design elements and 2 properties). 
We ran the algorithm on each property separately, which left us with 11 complex problems to study.
