# instructions:
# 1- in the current directory, wherever you have this script, create a folder under the name of experiments
# 2- copy all of the .lus models in the experiments folder
#    --> make sure you DON'T change the directory to the experiments folder. 
#    --> stay in the current directory, NOT in the experiments
# 3- get the latest jkind .jar files from here: https://github.com/elaghs/jkind/tree/support-paper/JAR-files
# 4- install jkind and set the path for it.
#    --> in Linux you should use the environment variable "JKIND_HOME" for it
#    --> in Windows you can put it in "path"
# 5- don't forget to install all the solvers that jkind needs (especially, z3, yices, yices2)
