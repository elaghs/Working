Alloy is a framework for describing high-level design of various systems, whose analyzer is a fully automatic constraint solver. Constraints are translated into propositional logic solved by a SAT solver; hence, the analysis considers only a finite number of values for each type. For this reason, even for a set of simple constraints, the analyzer is never able to prove the correctness of a property.
%our is proof
% our is SMT solver instead of SAT: much more
%they can efficiently prove a rich combination of decidable background theories without sacrificing completeness or full automation.
% we support diffrent pwerful smt solvers
