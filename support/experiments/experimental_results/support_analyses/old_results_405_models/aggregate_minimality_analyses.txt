-- we computed the size of biggest and smallest set in each model and added them together
-- the same calculation has been done for JSupport. And here is the result:


the aggregate number of elements in the SMALLEST support sets is: 3263
the aggregate number of elements in the BIGGEST support sets is: 3609
the aggregate number of elements in support sets computed by JSUPPORT is: 3078
average size of sets computed by JKind is(size of all (12 * 405) computed support sets by JKind/ (12 * 405), excluding unknown results: 8.54986020503262
