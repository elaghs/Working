\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

talk a little about symb MC
talk about IVC and why they are good
bring up the issue of multiple proof path, unsat-cores (MUS), IVCs
say that all IVC idea is brought up in the FSE paper, used and introduced in RE and coverage papers. But, the contribution of this paper is to provide an efficient technique to calculate all IVCs.
why we need to compute all IVCs (fault tolerance, coverage, traceability)
tell this work is based on the recent algorithm for fast computation of all MUSes
say that our work is a general and optimized version of the MARCO
