We are interested in examining the {\em efficacy} and {\em efficiency} of generating all minimal inductive validity cores with \aivcalg , as compared to algorithms for computing a {\em single approximately minimal} IVC (\ucalg), and a {\em minimal IVC} (\ucbfalg) as implemented in~\cite{Ghass16}.  In addition, we are also interested in determining whether the \aivcalg\ algorithm generates {\em smaller} cores than are generated by the \ucbfalg\ algorithm that generates a single \mivc.  If the \aivcalg\ algorithm is similarly efficient to \ucbfalg\ then several analyses can be performed that would not be possible with a single \mivc\ computed from the \ucbfalg\ algorithm.  We would also like to know how performance is affected by the size of models.
\footnote{Efficiency is computed in terms of wall-clock time.} 
Therefore, we investigate the following research questions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{RQ1:} How well does the \aivcalg ~algorithm for determining all minimal IVCs perform compared to the \ucalg ~and \ucbfalg ~algorithms, which find a single approximately minimal and guaranteed minimal IVC?
  \item \textbf{RQ2:} How is the verification time of the \aivcalg ~algorithm affected by the baseline proof time and the number of \mivc s that can be found for a property?
%
%  \item \textbf{RQ3)} How does approximating minimality influence the performance of the \aivcalg ~algorithm?
%  In other words, we would like to determine, for the implementation of the \getivc ~procedure, whether it would be better to use \ucalg ~or \ucbfalg .
%  \item \textbf{RQ4)} How did the pre-set timeout manifest itself in the experimental results?
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Experimental Setup}
Our experiment used the same benchmark suite as \cite{Ghass16} to enable straightforward comparison between the approaches. The benchmark contains 476 Lustre models  from~\cite{Hagen08:FMCAD} and \cite{QFCS15:backes,hilt2013}.
Most of the benchmark models from~\cite{Hagen08:FMCAD} are small (10kB or less, with 6-40 equations) and include a range of hardware benchmarks and software problems involving counters that are difficult to solve inductively.
The models from \cite{QFCS15:backes,hilt2013} are industrial models with over 600 equations and each are approximately 80kB in size.  Each benchmark model has a single property to analyze.  For each test model, we computed \aivcalg , \ucalg , and \ucbfalg ~algorithms in a configuration with the \texttt{Z3} solver and the ``fastest'' mode of \texttt{JKind} (which involves running the K-induction and PDR engines in parallel and terminating when a solution is found). The experiments were run on an  Intel(R) i5-4690, 3.50GHz, 16 GB memory machine running Windows 10.
