\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

talk a little about symb MC

talk about IVC and why they are good

bring up the issue of multiple proof path, unsat-cores (MUS), IVCs

say that all IVC idea is brought up in the FSE paper, used and introduced in RE and coverage papers. But, the contribution of this paper is to provide an efficient technique to calculate all IVCs.

why we need to compute all IVCs (fault tolerance, coverage, traceability)

contribution: minimum, minimal, must...

tell this work is based on the recent algorithm for fast computation of all MUSes

say that our work is a general and optimized version of the MARCO

MARCO and other algorithms in the domain of infeasibility analysis
