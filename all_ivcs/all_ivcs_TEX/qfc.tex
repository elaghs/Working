\section{Scalability Case Study}

\label{sec:qfc}
The benchmark models from~\cite{expr} are of modest size.  To examine the scalability of our approach for large models with large numbers of IVCs, we used one substantially larger model to analyze, a NASA Quad-redundant Flight Control System (QFCS) model from~\cite{NFM2015:backes}. %developed using the AADL AGREE tool suite \cite{NFM2012:CoGa}.
%The QFCS has a hierarchical architecture consisting of several components.
%The monotonic model has 50,635 design elements (LUSTRE equations), 7,719 of which are registers.
For this study we examined two of the model components: the Flight Control System (FCS) (with 5,259 equations,708 integer delays, and 2 properties) and the Flight Control Computers (FCC) (with 9,953 equations, 1703 integer delays, and 9 properties), running each property separately.\ela{these are numbers before slicing. after slicing the number of registers is nothing. why don't we just use the number of equations after slicing (without number of pre). after all IVCs are all equations for us}

%We ran the algorithm on each property separately, which left us with 11 complex problems to study.
