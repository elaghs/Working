% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.

%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

\begin{abstract}
Requirements are the key part of any system design. And, the common goal in formal
verification is to verify the validity of the requirements.
Once the verification process is done, one perennial question is that have we specified enough requirements? In other words, oftentimes, we are in need of a method for judgment on the quality of a system
specification. This question is akin to the problem of
test suite adequacy in testing well-addressed with different coverage metrics.
However, in the context of property-based verification, coverage is more difficult to define and compute.
This paper proposes a novel coverage notion that determines
which parts of a design are necessary to establish the proof of a given specification,
whereby requirement adequacy is achieved when all the design artifacts are
essential in the satisfaction proof of the conjunction of all requirements.
We present and implemented an efficient algorithm for quantifying requirements completeness based
on inductive proofs of
safety properties for sequential systems integrated into state-of-the-art SAT-based Model Checking. We compare/ benchmark
 our method against the existing techniques in the literature. Besides, based on the idea of inductive validity cores, we sketch
more complementary coverage notions.

%\mike{Note: mine traceability paper for ideas: abstract notion of proof?   Distinction between proof and entailment?  }

%\mike{Start from (a variant of) the formalism from the RE paper.  Then use inductive validity cores as an {\em implementation} of this idea, again just like the RE paper.  Bring in the IVC formalism only when we describe it as an ``implementation'' of our general idea.}


\mike{There is a very close analogue between our notion of SOS (finding minimal model elements) and the notion of mutual vacuity for requirements (maximal strengthenings of requirements); we need to look into this. }

\mike{One interesting question: is there an analogue to the ``strongest passing formula'' work by Chockler as explored in Form Methods Syst Des (2013) 43:552â€“571 DOI 10.1007/s10703-013-0192-6, and a maximal model weakening?  Such a thing would involve changing logical operators within the model rather than simply removing equations.}

\mike{Our running example does not have many illustrations of multiple satisfactions...should I add a "mistake" to one of the requirements?  I did this to show differences between requirements }

\mike{We could have a better example if we did some kind of sensor fusion in the model - we could have a 'pick 2 of 3' kind of thing; lots of different satisfaction paths}
